## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where two intellectuals, fiercely opposed in theory, must collaborate on a mundane, physical task (e.g., fixing a leak, assembling furniture), forcing their abstract debate into the realm of the tactile.
- Create a monologue from the perspective of a historical feminist text (like the Wollstonecraft book) observing the two protagonists and commenting on their modern struggles.
- Imagine a 'philosophical ghost story' where a concept one of them is studying (e.g., Keats's mortality, Wollstonecraft's 'heart') begins to manifest in their shared environment.
- Write a letter from Elara to Leo (or vice versa) ten years after the events of the novel, reflecting on whether their 'exquisite vandalism' was a success or a failure.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Dialectic Engine' web app that allows two users to have a real-time, structured debate. The interface forces them to label their statements as Thesis, Antithesis, or Synthesis, and visualizes the conversation as a branching tree of ideas.
- Create an AI-text analysis tool that scans a manuscript and identifies the 'academic voice' (jargon, citation density, rhetorical style) of characters, then generates a short, contrasting dialogue in their distinct voices on a new topic.
